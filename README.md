# Serum207Maker
Plugin which automates creation of serum207

# Runtime assumptions
* Your nearby banker which can be interacted with from your current position.
* Your inventory is empty.
* You have sufficient tarromin unf potions and ashes in bank.

# Performance
I am not sure what performance this is supposed to have, it stabilizes at around barely 20,000 potions/hr.
If you know how to make this faster please open a PR.

# Acknowledgments
Vanna for requesting me to make this script i otherwise wouldn't even know of.
